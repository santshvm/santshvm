## Summary

CS undergrad with an insatiable appetite for learning new programming languages and tech stacks through hands-on project building. Passionate about open-source, collaboration, and innovation. While I enjoy web development, I've recently been exploring the exciting world of data science and machine learning, with the goal of transitioning to this field in the near future.

## What I've Been Up To Lately
Over the past few months, I've been dipping my toes into data science and machine learning, learning as much as I can and working on personal projects to build my skills. Although I'm still at the beginning of my journey, I'm already starting to see the power of these technologies and the potential they offer to drive innovation and solve problems.  That's why I've recently started exploring the exciting world of data science and machine learning, with the goal of transitioning to this field in the near future. 

Some of the things I've been focusing on lately include:

- Learning the Python programming language and its data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- Exploring data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to prepare data for analysis and machine learning.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models using popular algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- Learning how to use powerful tools like TensorFlow and Keras to build deep learning models for complex problems.

## My Goal
My goal is to continue to deepen my knowledge and skills in data science and machine learning, with the aim of transitioning into this exciting field in the near future. While I have a lot to learn, I'm passionate about this area and excited about the opportunities it offers to make a real impact with data.

Let's team up and create something extraordinary together!

**Note:** Most of my recent contributions have been in private repositories. However, I'm actively working on several exciting projects and hope to make them public soon!
